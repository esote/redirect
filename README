NAME
	redirect - web server for 308 subdomain redirects

SYNOPSIS
	redirect file

DESCRIPTION
	redirect is a web server for 308 subdomain redirects.

	The input file to redirect describes the valid subdomain routes. Each
	line consists of a "from" host and "to" URL separated by space. For
	example:

		localhost:8441		https://localhost:1001
		w.localhost:8441	https://x.localhost:1002
		x.localhost:8441	https://z.localhost:1003

	The buffer length, listening port, queue size, and timeout duration are
	defined in redirect.h. The default port is 8441, so the "from" route
	hosts should match this port.
